      <p>
        The capybara or greater capybara (Hydrochoerus hydrochaeris) is a giant
        cavy rodent native to South America. It is the largest living rodent and
        a member of the genus Hydrochoerus. The only other extant member is the
        lesser capybara (Hydrochoerus isthmius). Its close relatives include
        guinea pigs and rock cavies, and it is more distantly related to the
        agouti, the chinchilla, and the nutria. The capybara inhabits savannas
        and dense forests, and lives near bodies of water. It is a highly social
        species and can be found in groups as large as 100 individuals, but
        usually live in groups of 10-20 individuals. The capybara is hunted for
        its meat and hide and also for grease from its thick fatty skin.

      <h1>Etymology</h1>
      <p>
        Its common name is derived from Tupi ka'apiûara, a complex agglutination
        of kaá (leaf) + píi (slender) + ú (eat) + ara (a suffix for agent
        nouns), meaning "one who eats slender leaves", or "grass-eater".[4] The
        genus name, hydrochoerus, comes from Greek ὕδωρ (hydor "water") and
        χοῖρος (choiros "pig, hog") and the species name, hydrochaeris, comes
        from Greek ὕδωρ (hydor "water") and χαίρω (chairo "feel happy, enjoy").
